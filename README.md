# Employee Manage-ment Application

First you open the -> Login Page , 
Then on login page you will be asked for ID &&  Password 

I am providing the employe ID's and Passwor 

ALL Employee ID's -> {
    1. employee1@example.com
    2. employee2@example.com
    3. employee3@example.com
    4. employee4@example.com
    5. employee5@example.com
}

And All ID's passcode is same that is -> { 1234 }

Also I am providing admin id and password -> { 1234 } you can add & give more tasks to employes the 
but one thing is do not refresh the page after log out admin@me.com becaus i have stor tha data in browser local storge 
it can not add more data but I promise I will fix this problem soon

Thanku....
